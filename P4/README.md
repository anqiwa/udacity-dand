#Summary

This dataset contains 1157 baseball players, among which 892 are valid.The attributes of players include handedness, height, weight, batting average, and home runs. I want to explore them and find out the key differences between strong and weak players. 

#Design

I compared handedness, height, weight, and BMI of these players, and initially selected scatterplot, and each bubble represented the attributes of one player. I also included several attributes in one chart, which looked fancy but confusing as well. As a result, after several people's feedback, I finally selected bar chart and included only two attributes in each chart.
